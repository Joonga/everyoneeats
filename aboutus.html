                <h2>Phone recycle program</h2>
                <h3>Donate an old phone, these phones can be handed to a person in need so they can access the app, recuse e-waste (electronic waste). Most people hold onto their old phones. Relatively new phones are usually passed onto friends or family however older phones that have stopped receiving support for services such as banking and App Stores do not have much value in them anymore. A lot of these phones however can access a browser and this app can be accessed through a browser as it is a PWA so it adds functionality to the app. </h3>

                <h2>Working With Retailers</h2>
                <h3>CeX is a shop that sells second hand electronics. Some electronics have very little value and are just using up shelf space not being sold. These phones can be repurposed as devices that can access Anyone Eats. </h3>

                <h2>Using the Internet</h2>
                <h3>Many public libraries free public Wi-Fi networks that can let users access the Anyone Eats app. Some train and bus stations also have free Wi-Fi. Network provider Three UK once used to offer a free data SIM that allowed for 200MB for free. 200MB isn’t a lot for the average user however it would be perfect for Anyone Eats. The company could partner with a network provider to supply mobile phones with a small free data allowance to allow the homeless to be able to access the app. Internet speeds can be throttled if needed as a way of crowd control, you don’t need an ultrafast 5G connection to browse food. Throttling internet speeds can make sure that the data is only being used for what they were intended for and can make sure that the small allowance of data isn’t consumed too quickly. </h3>
